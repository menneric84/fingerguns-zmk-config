![12col variant of fingerguns](/pictures/11.jpg)
# v1.1
v1.1 includes support for one ALPS EC12 rotary encoder that can be placed in either the right or the left corner.  Both sockets are wired to the same pins (gpio 0 and gpio 1), so only one can be used at a time.

Pinout is identical, but the ZMK repo is not currently configured for rotary encoders.  I will dive into rotary encoders in ZMK when I have time.

Other changes: moved MCU closer to the edge, rotated hotswaps on col10 (the 11th column) to make design of the 10col case easier.

# ZMK
YOU MUST CHECK fingerguns.overlay TO ENSURE THE PROPER PHYSICAL LAYOUT IS CHOSEN

Please see the comments on line 4 of fingerguns.overlay.  In the 'chosen' node, you will need to adjust zmk,physical-layout depending on if you are using the 12 column variant or the 10 column variant of the Fingerguns PCB.

The 12 column is represented by &layout_12col
The 10 column is represented by &layout_10col

YOU MUST SELECT OR CREATE AN APPROPRIATE KEYMAP

In the ergomech community a keymap is an intensely personal thing.  That being said, I've included my own 12 column and 10 column keymaps in case you need somewhere to start.  Please note that fingerguns.keymap is intended for the 10 column variant.  A 12 column keymap is also included under the name fingerguns.keymap.12col.  If you wish to use 12 columns, simply append '.10col' to the default keymap and delete '.12col' from the other one.

# QMK?
I haven't tried it, but there's no reason it wouldn't work fine.  You'll find the pinout in the kicad schematic.  Please reach out and let me know how it goes!  If you get it up and running I'd be happy to add a QMK option to the repo.

# BOM
36-42 choc switches & keycaps  
36-42 choc hotswaps  
36-42 smd diodes  
6 M2 heat set inserts  
6 M2 x 6mm screws  
6 rubber bumpons (recommended)  
1 MSK12C02 switch  
1 Panasonic EVQPUJ_EVQPUA button  
1 pro micro form factor MCU  
1 301230 110mAh battery (optional)  

If you are confused about switches, all parts except the inserts and screws can be sourced from typeractive.xyz.

# BUILDING
![fingerguns on the hotplate](/pictures/3.jpg)
If planning to use the case, the MCU should be soldered with the included headers, NOT sockets.  The sockets add too much height to fit in the case.  A hot plate is recommended for assembly, as it makes the whole process very quick and easy.  Assembly is possible by hand with a soldering iron, though it can be delicate and frustrating.  For the diodes and switches, I recommend tinning one pad first, then placing the component with tweezers before soldering the other side.  Some of the photos show a battery pigtail, but ultimately I decided to solder the battery wires directly to the board and stick the battery down with a command strip.

# CASES
![12col fingerguns 3d printed case](/pictures/8.jpg)
Files are included to 3d print a case for the 12col variant, designed by my brother.  PCB is secured with 6 M2 heat set inserts. The 10col case is still in development, but will be added to the repo when it's done.  I've also included a .step file of the PCB under /gerbers_and_kicad if you'd like to design your own.

![Caseless 10col](/pictures/7.jpg)
Fingerguns is also perfectly useable without a case if you stick a few bumpons on the hotswaps.  I placed a total of six, at the four corners and at the corners of the bottom row.
